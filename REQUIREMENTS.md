Coach-client system

- One coach — many clients
- A coach’s client can be a coach to other people too
- A coach should be able to remotely view the client’s training log
- A coach should be able to comment/change a client’s current training log
- The changes should appear in real time instantaneously
- The client should be able to accept/decline the changes made by the coach (just in case)
- Comments don’t need approval, only changes
- The client and the coach should be able to chat in the app
- The chat must provide the ability to attach links to objects from the training log to the message

Training log structure

- Mesocycles, training weeks, training days, types of progression for a given period of time/exercise, etc.
- A training week is not necessarily seven days
- A mesocycle is several training weeks + deload (if needed)
- A training day includes different exercises, for each exercise
